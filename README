Array-PseudoScalar

Sometimes lists of values need to be alternatively treated as arrays
or as scalars (joined by a separator character), depending on the
context.  This is often the case for example with parameters of an
HTTP query, or with "varray" columns in a database.  Code dealing with
such data is usually full of calls to L<join> or L<split>.

The present module provides a uniform interface for treating the same
data both as an arrayref and as a scalar, implicitly joined on some
separator: usual array and string operations are both available.
